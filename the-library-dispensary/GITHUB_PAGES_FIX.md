# GitHub Pages CSS Fix - The Library Dispensary

## Problem Identified
The website CSS was not loading on GitHub Pages due to incorrect asset paths. The Next.js static export was generating paths like `/_next/static/css/` instead of `/library-dispensary-preview/_next/static/css/`.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing .nojekyll File
- **Issue**: GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default, which ignores directories starting with underscore (_next)
- **Fix**: Created `.nojekyll` file in the out directory to disable Jekyll processing

### 2. ✅ Incorrect Asset Paths
- **Issue**: Next.js basePath not fully applied to all asset URLs in the HTML
- **Fix**: Created `fix-github-paths.sh` script to update all asset paths with the correct basePath

### 3. ✅ Build Configuration
- **Issue**: Next.js config had basePath set but wasn't applying to all resources
- **Fix**: Post-build script fixes the paths after Next.js generates the static files

## Files Created

1. **`.nojekyll`** - Prevents Jekyll processing on GitHub Pages
2. **`fix-github-paths.sh`** - Fixes all asset paths in HTML files
3. **`deploy-to-github.sh`** - Automated deployment script

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Build the project
npm run build

# 2. Fix the paths
./fix-github-paths.sh

# 3. Deploy to GitHub
./deploy-to-github.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# 1. Build the project
npm run build

# 2. Fix the paths
./fix-github-paths.sh

# 3. Copy the contents of the 'out' directory to your GitHub repository
# 4. Make sure .nojekyll file is included
# 5. Commit and push to GitHub
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check CSS Loading**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://bknddevelopment.github.io/library-dispensary-preview/_next/static/css/61bb03cf715116db.css
   ```
   Should return HTTP 200 with content-type: text/css

2. **Check in Browser**:
   - Visit: https://bknddevelopment.github.io/library-dispensary-preview/
   - Open Developer Console (F12)
   - Check Network tab for any 404 errors
   - Verify styles are applied correctly

## Build Process Summary

The complete build and deploy process is now:

1. **Development**: `npm run dev`
2. **Build**: `npm run build`
3. **Fix Paths**: `./fix-github-paths.sh`
4. **Deploy**: `./deploy-to-github.sh`

## Key Configuration

**next.config.js**:
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  basePath: '/library-dispensary-preview',
  assetPrefix: '/library-dispensary-preview',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true
  },
  trailingSlash: true
};
```

## Troubleshooting

If styles still don't load:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Force refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Check GitHub Actions**: Visit https://github.com/bknddevelopment/library-dispensary-preview/actions
3. **Verify Files**: Ensure all files in `out/_next/static/` are present in the repository
4. **Check Console**: Look for any CORS or security errors in browser console

## Notes

- GitHub Pages may take 5-10 minutes to update after pushing
- The site is configured for the subdirectory: `/library-dispensary-preview`
- All assets must use this basePath to load correctly
- The .nojekyll file is critical - without it, _next directories won't be served

## Success Indicators

✅ CSS files load with HTTP 200 status
✅ No 404 errors in browser console
✅ Site displays with proper styling
✅ All images and fonts load correctly
✅ JavaScript functionality works as expected
