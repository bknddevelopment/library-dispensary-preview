# Pages Router Migration - Phase 1 Complete

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Pages Directory Structure
- `/pages/index.tsx` - Home page placeholder
- `/pages/about.tsx` - About page placeholder
- `/pages/services.tsx` - Services page placeholder
- `/pages/education.tsx` - Education page placeholder
- `/pages/education-pdf.tsx` - Education PDF page placeholder
- `/pages/first-visit.tsx` - First Visit page placeholder
- `/pages/location.tsx` - Location page placeholder
- `/pages/art-collection.tsx` - Art Collection page placeholder

### 2. Created Core Pages Router Files
- `/pages/_app.tsx` - Application wrapper with Inter font and global styles
- `/pages/_document.tsx` - HTML document structure with meta tags

### 3. Updated Configuration
- Created `next.config.js` (replaced next.config.ts) with Pages Router configuration
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to include pages directory in compilation paths

### 4. Created SEO Component
- `/components/SEO.tsx` - Centralized metadata handling component for Pages Router

### 5. Moved Global Styles
- Moved `globals.css` from `/app` to `/styles` directory
- Updated import in `_app.tsx` to use new location

### 6. Verified Build
- Successfully built with Pages Router (app directory temporarily renamed during build)
- All pages compile and export correctly
- TypeScript compilation passes for new Pages Router files

## üìù Notes

- **App directory preserved**: The original `/app` directory remains intact as requested
- **"use client" directives**: Will be removed when migrating components in Phase 2
- **Build conflicts**: The app and pages directories cannot coexist during build, will need to handle this in Phase 2
- **Static export**: Configured for static export with `output: 'export'`

## üöÄ Ready for Phase 2

The Pages Router structure is now in place and ready for content migration. All placeholder pages are functional and the build system is configured correctly.

Next steps in Phase 2:
- Migrate component content from app directory
- Remove "use client" directives from components
- Update component imports to use Pages Router APIs
- Test each migrated page
